During my junior year I was co-president of Space Technologies at Cal (STAC), an on-campus student-led research organization that focuses on designing and manufacturing creative engineering solutions to space engineering problems.

Inspired by what I had learned in my quantum coursework, I initiated a project that applied existing UC Berkeley research on quantum gyroscopes based on NV–centers in diamonds to miniature satellite technology. Please see the [STAC Webpage](https://stac.berkeley.edu/project/qubesat){:target="\_blank"} for more information about the status and design on the project.

The QubeSat project’s primary goal is to research the effects of space environments on quantum gyroscopes, a groundbreaking experimental sensor based on nitrogen vacancies (NV-) centers in diamonds. In comparison to more traditional onboard micromechanical gyroscopes, quantum gyroscopes provide improved resolution, improved drift stability and increased temperature operational range. QubeSat’s upcoming mission will allow us to evaluate the effect of the harsh space environment — including extreme temperatures, radiation, and magnetic field variation — that could affect the gyroscopes’s performance in small-scale spaceflight. QubeSat’s secondary goal is to increase the accessibility of space and to inspire STEM education. Increasing accessibility to space starts at UC Berkeley and the STAC community, which is a group of over 60 passionate students who are working on a range of technologies aimed at making strides in space research. 

Following a successful ideation effort based upon this premise, I was part of the team that spearheaded an accepted application for NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI) worth up to $300,000. The CSLI provides access to space for universities, high schools, and nonprofit organizations through fully funded launch opportunities, however it does not provide funding for the manufacturing of the satellite.

Of the 32 proposals that were submitted during the 11th round of candidates, the QubeSat mission was [selected](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-announces-11th-round-of-candidates-for-cubesat-space-missions){:target="\_blank"} in the top 10, securing a vital part of the missions success. Through the Student Technology Fund we were also given a grant of $4,995 which will go towards both the scientific payload and the manufacturing of the CubeSat. The grant writing process involved developing a working relationship with the Space Science Laboratory (SSL) at Berkeley, securing sponsorships from local space tech companies and laying out scientific, engineering and operational strategies.
