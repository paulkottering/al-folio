Hello my name is Paul K&ouml;ttering. I am interested in quantum computing, scientific machine learning and financial mathematics.

I graduated from UC Berkeley in December 2020 with a major in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Physics. During the Spring 2021 semester I will be working full-time with Professor Lin in the UC Berkeley Department of Mathematics. I am looking to attend graduate school in Fall 2021.
